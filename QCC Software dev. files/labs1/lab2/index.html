Hello! I’m hailing from Brooklyn, NY. I’m A entry level growth marketer. I enjoy driving discovering new places all over the country(road trips). I’ve joined the micro credential boot camp to hopefully learn the basics and grow from their. I hope to network with good people and build relationships with like-minded people. I hope to learn enough to get an entry level job or internship.
